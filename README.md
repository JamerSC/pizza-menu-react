# Components

- React made out ofcomponents
- Building Block or UI
- Components has its own data, logic, & appearance.
- build complex UI by building multiple components & combining them.
- Components can be reused, nested, inside other, and pass data between them.

component = {"Data", "Logic", "Appearance"};

# What is JSX?

- JSX - declarative syntax to describe what components look like and how they work.
- Components must return a block of JSX
- JSX extension of JS allows to embed JS, CSS, & React ccomponents into HTML
- Eash JSX element is converted to React.createElement function call
- We could use React w/out JSX

# JS is an imperative approach - How to do things

- Manual DOM element selections and DOM traversing.
- Step by stem dom mutations until me reach desired UI

# JSX is declarative approach - What we want

- Describe what UI should look like using JSX, based on current data
- React is an abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM
- instead, we think of the UI as a reflection of current data.

# Created More Components

- Nested Components
